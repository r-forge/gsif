Research Checklist
------------------

- Define a function for the hotspot threshold
	- Done 
	- pooled all years by month and  determined the threshold to be 
		the temperatures in the last 2.5% area of the normal curve
	- Further, found the continuous best fitting line through those points
		* May or may not use this
	- Potential Issue: We need lots of data to make this analysis
		* May not be an issue if we can query 2001-2010 in order to 
			define extreme conditions for current and future years
		
- Develop a matlab script that allows you to specify a convex hull of the 
	geographic area you are interested in
	- Consider using pre-existing tools instead (Sam's work)
	- Need to figure out a geographic picture that is correctly aligned
		with the tiff picture
	- Need to map (x,y) click coordinates to matrix coordinates
	- Need to figure out how to extract non-square submatrices
	- Should be able to use built-in matlab functions for this
	
- Determine if it's appropriate to use extreme cold as well as extreme hot

- Redo paje visualization with newly defined threshold function
	- verify results

- Apply cdf analysis test using the newly defined hotspot threshold function
	- Analyze results
	- Could provide issues because there is so little data
